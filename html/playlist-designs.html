      <h1><b>Playlist Designs</b></h1>
      <h5><i>Made for personal use </i></h5>
      <br><br>

      <h3><b>The Details</b></h3>
      <p><b><i>Platform:</i></b> Tumblr<br>
      <b><i>Audience:</i></b> Over 30,000 personal blog followers + other fans on the platform who can view through tags<br>
      <b><i>Images:</i></b> offical photoshoots, artist's Instagram photos, official music video screencaps</p>

      <h3><b>Project Background</b></h3>

      <p>Being a kpop fan back in 2009 was my introduction to niche online communities. It opened the door for me to interact with people all around the world who enjoy the same artists I do, to share songs, news, and fanmade items (whether they were virtual graphics or actual handmade goods). While I no longer hang out in these highly satuturated spaces now, I still enjoy doing those very things that drew me to join fandom spaces in the first place: being able to share my interests with others who feel the same.</p>

      <p>With the creation of Spotify, it has become so much easier to make and share large playlists of songs with others. Before we could only copy and paste Youtube links to friends or use some makeshift playlist site that used a Youtube API anyways. However, a lot of social media platforms currently are very visual. If you paste a link into the internet void, not many people will be willing to click on it. For myself, I mainly blog and share my thoughts on Tumblr and Twitter - both websites are highly visual and a Spotify link could easily get lost. <b>So I decided to make designs for my playlist posts: Visual Playlists.</b></p><br>

      <h3><b>What's Your Sign: Astrology Based Playlists</b></h3>
      <p style="font-size:12px;">Made from 03/28/2020 to 12/30/2020<p>
      <p>During the height of quarantine in the United States in March 2020, I decided to ask my followers if they wanted astrological playlists. I was in an art slump at the time and thought this would be a cool opportunity for me to climb out of it by combining 3 topics that I love into one: music, astrology, and design (and if you didn't know Spotify actually makes some of their own <a href="https://open.spotify.com/genre/cosmic_campaign">Cosmic Playlists</a> too!)<br>What I thought would be another fun stint between me and my followers turned into <b>16 full fledged, unique playlists made across the span of 9 months.</b> The playlists themselves got a lot of love from my followers and others on Tumblr which was what gave it such longevity: people just kept requesting for more!<br>

      <h5><b>The Thought Process</b></h5>
      It allowed me to brainstorm how to express non-visual topics (astrological signs and music) in visual elements. I used official photos of the artist that I would like to essentially "headline" my playlist or I would work with music video screencaps if I thought a certain song express the feelings of the zodiac signs I wanted to portray. I used loud, vibrant colors to create quirky, eye catching designs but made sure to keep the text legible.<br><br>Below are a few playlist designs from the entire project that I like most. They are usually displayed in two separate images: one of the main cover and the other one being the tracklist but I condensed them into one larger image here for easier viewing.<br></p>

      <h3><b>Our Favorite Songs of 2020: Collaboration Playlists</b></h3><br>
      <p>This is another playlist project that involved my followers: creating a mega playlist of all of our favorite songs from 2020. I decided to make both a mid-year playlist for songs released from January to July and then another playlist at the end of the year that would emcompass all releases. It's a fun way to recommend your favorite songs to others and also see what they enjoyed listening to during the year. The playlist mix could also serve as a small time capsule for my followers and I to look back on and see what type of music we loved during this year of our lives.<br>I kept the design of the two playlists similar so that even someone skimming briefly would notice that they are a part of the same project.<p>

      <h3><b>Concluding Thoughts</b></h3>
      <p>I make playlist graphics as means to share music in a more visually appealing way on social media platforms, but it's also a fun hobby to practice and experiment with design choices I might not make otherwise. Since they are made to mainly fulfill my personal joy, I can get away with more strange designs or colors that might not be liked elsewhere. They serve as mini time capsules hidden away to document my music taste and design style at the time, sort of like finding that one diary you had as a kid.<br>It also is a great way for my followers who live in countries that don't have access to Spotify, or in case Spotify stopped working, to view the full tracklist and search up the songs or even recreate my playlists on other music apps for their own personal listening.</p>
